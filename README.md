# Friday-Project-6
This project is meant to practice using tkinter and its geometry managers to create GUIs.
There are three files in this project with each using a different geometry manager.

## Files
1. `pack.py`: Using the pack geometry manager, this file is used to create a simple calculator interface.
2. `grid.py`: Using the grid geometry manager, this file is used to create a sign up page.
3. `place.py`: Using the place geometry manager, this file is used to create a log in page.
